# Bethanys-Pie-Shop-Blazor
This repository holds a practice application for learning Blazor for the first time. 

Bethany needs an HRM site to manage her employees. She specifically wants it her application to be made with client-side Blazor. Not sure why tho.

## Blazor
Blazor is released (May 2020) :tada:! That means I'm jumping on to check it out ASAP!

Blazor allows us to build interactive Web UIs in C# without Javascript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.
